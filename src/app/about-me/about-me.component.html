    <h3>Path to Burlington</h3>
    <p>I graduated college in 2008 - during one of the worst financial crises that our country has faced. I was very lucky that my brother is a true entrepreneur and was just starting a new marketing business out of his basement and needed help. He's since grown his business immensely and is often in Inc. Magazine's list of growing businesses. I'm very proud of him and grateful to have been at the start of his journey. But I craved an adventure and a path of my own.</p>
    <p>I moved to Washington D.C. to explore living in a great city and being close to friends. It was in D.C. that I also fell in love and became engaged. His career took him north to the University of New Hampshire -- and so we went!</p>
    <p>We fell in love with New England's charm. However, I did not find a career I was content with and my husband had by now finsihed his Master's degree and began looking for the next step in his career. This led us to Delaware.</p>
    <p>I'll always be grateful that we moved to Delaware, because it was through a program there that I was able to invest and find my own career in Software Development. I worked for a truly wonderful company that helped me grow and become stronger.</p>
    <p>An unbelievable job offer came up for my husband to work at the University of Vermont. It is truly his dream job. All it took was for me to step foot into downtown Burlington to absolutely fall in love with this fairytale of a city. I had never seen such a mesh of nature and beauty against the charm of strong architecture. We are so excited to put down roots and explore beautiful Vermont!</p>

      <h3>Path to Development</h3>
      <p> My mother always stated that I could do and be whatever I wanted in life. Her advice never waiverd from: "Follow your bliss!". Throughout high school, I was heavily involved in the arts. With love, a lot of hard-work, and talent, I participated in every music and art driven event I could. I found a special passion with singing and continued studying it for ten years. I was fascinated at how a person could break down and analyze the specific placement sound in your throat and mouth and how it completely changed the tone. By pressing forward, the voice comes out loud and operatic, and by sitting it back it becomes throaty and jazzy. I loved acting and analyzing how you could break down and analyze every emotion into its core physical expression. Sadness begins with a tightening in the throat. I loved literature and how breaking down the author's tools and the society they were writing too changed the whole meaning of their work. </p>
      <p> When I graduated, I found that the world of art and performance was too unsteady and insecure for me. I pursued business endeavors, sales support, accounting administration, customer services. However, I kept finding that my need to break things down and analyze how they worked was not working in a fast-paced business environment.</p>
      <p> I began taking online quizzes, over and over again, asking the sage question: "What should I do with my life?". And the internet answered. Time and again the same response of computer programming came up. It was to the point that I thought it was worth looking into.</p> 
      <p> I came across a local program called Zip Code Wilmington. To apply they had you complete a CodeCademy course on javascript. I found that a programming language was indeed a language. And like any other language it can be used to create and express ideas. I was immediately hooked. In software development I had at last found carrer that fit how my brain works. Development has what felt like the culmination of my compulsive need to break things down. I find it addicting and gratifying in ways that I could never have imagined. I am so excited to continue learning to grow and work in this brand new playground.</p>
